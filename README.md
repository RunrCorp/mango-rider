A new type of ridesharing app.

This is the rider-only app.

If you would like to join the team, please contact one of the contributors *or* email [**runrteam@gmail.com**](mailto:runrteam@gmail.com).

# getting started

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view the [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers a quick start guide, tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

# project environment setup

#### all platforms

Make sure to run `$ flutter pub get` after navigating to your project directory.  This will install all dependencies from `pubspec.yaml`.

Create a `.env` file in your project root with a single line in it: `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=_______________`.

Then insert a Google Maps API key in this `.env` file after the equal sign.

#### ios only

If you are planning on using an iOS device/simulator to test the app, please run `.gitconfig.sh` after filling out the `.env` file.  This will automatically insert the API key into your AppDelegate.swift and ensure the API key is not commited to Git.

Note: You must run `.gitconfig.sh` each time you clone (*not* pull or checkout, but **clone**) the repository as it edits your local/project Git config files.

#### android only

If you are planning on using an Android device/simulator to test the app, please follow [**this**](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth) guide to get the SHA-1 of your signing certificate.  Once you have obtained this, please send it to one of the contributors *or* email [**runrteam@gmail.com**](mailto:runrteam@gmail.com) so we can add it to the Firebase console.  

Note: This is necessary to authenticate using Google Sign-In on Android during development.  Otherwise, your app will crash after clicking `Google Sign-In` on the app login page.
